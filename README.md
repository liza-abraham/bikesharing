Using NYC Citibike Data to gauge the viability of Citibike in Des Moines
Introduction:

Though they are in many ways very different cities, New York and Des Moines run along the same line of longitude and have similar weather patterns - with August being one of the driest and most temperate months. This analysis will examine the following for August 2019 usage of Citibike in New York, pursuant to: 

 - Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Results:
The first visualization shows that male rides tend to check out bikes for a much longer time than female riders. 
The second visualization shows that there is an uptick in rides from Thursday through Sunday. In addition, for all days, most rides occur at the start of the day (before 9 am) or towards the end of the day (after 5 pm)
The one exception to this is Saturday where this high usage around midday, with this trend continuing somewhat into Sunday.


Summary:
-Citibike is a tenable business model for a city in which there is a large male customer base willing to become subscribers, and use the bike to commute and to and from work. 
-In addition, there is an income stream to be had during the midday on the weekends when all genders, as well as subscribers and non-subscribers, use the bikes for recreation.
